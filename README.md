### Project: Restaurant Rating Analysis & Prediction
🔹 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing, visualizing, and predicting restaurant ratings based on various factors such as location, price range, cuisine type, and availability of online delivery & table booking.

Using Python and machine learning, we gain valuable insights into customer preferences and build a predictive model to estimate restaurant ratings. The project is structured into three levels:

1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Exploration
2️⃣ Trend Analysis & Feature Engineering
3️⃣ Predictive Modeling & Customer Insights

🔹 Data Used
📌 Dataset: The dataset contains information about restaurants, including:
✔ City & Country
✔ Cuisines Offered
✔ Average Ratings
✔ Price Range
✔ Number of Votes
✔ Availability of Online Delivery & Table Booking
✔ Latitude & Longitude

The dataset helps us understand how different factors impact restaurant ratings and enables us to build a predictive model.

🔹 Tech Stack
✅ Data Handling & Processing
pandas → Data manipulation

numpy → Numerical computations

✅ Data Visualization
matplotlib → Basic plotting

seaborn → Statistical visualizations

plotly → Interactive visualizations

folium → Geospatial mapping

✅ Machine Learning
scikit-learn → Model training & evaluation

RandomForestRegressor & LinearRegression → Predictive modeling

📌 Project Breakdown
🔹 Level 1: Data Cleaning & Exploration
✔ Checked for missing values & handled them appropriately
✔ Converted categorical data into numerical format (Label Encoding)
✔ Explored restaurant ratings, cuisines, and price distribution
✔ Visualized geographical distribution using folium

🔹 Level 2: Business Trend Analysis
✔ Analyzed the impact of table booking & online delivery on ratings
✔ Identified the most popular cuisines & highest-rated cities
✔ Engineered new features such as Restaurant_Name_Length
✔ Used Plotly to create interactive graphs for better insights

🔹 Level 3: Predictive Modeling & Customer Insights
✔ Trained a Machine Learning model (Random Forest, Linear Regression) to predict ratings
✔ Used Label Encoding to convert categorical data
✔ Evaluated model performance using MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
✔ Created interactive bar charts for better data representation

📊 Results & Insights
📌 Findings from the Analysis:
✔ Cities like Bangalore & Delhi have the highest-rated restaurants
✔ Restaurants that offer table booking & online delivery tend to have higher ratings
✔ Fine dining restaurants receive higher ratings than budget restaurants
✔ North Indian & Italian cuisines are among the most highly rated

📌 Machine Learning Model Performance:

Model	MAE (Lower is Better)
Linear Regression	0.92 
Random Forest	0.11
Conclusion: The Random Forest model performed better, showing a strong ability to predict restaurant ratings based on key factors.


🔗 Future Improvements
🚀 Enhance model performance with deep learning (Neural Networks)
🚀 Use NLP techniques to analyze customer reviews
🚀 Create a web app to allow users to predict restaurant ratings interactively
